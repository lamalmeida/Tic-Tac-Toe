# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Python program that implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You can play against 2 different levels of a computer. Level 1 follows a few predetermined rules which means it can lose, while level 2 has a minimax algorithm which makes it impossible for the computer to lose.

This is also the first of two more projects coming out soon with games and minimax implementations.

## How to run

To start the game, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the file `tictactoe.py`. Then type the following command:

`python tictactoe.py`

## How to play

The game board is a 3x3 grid of squares. The first player uses X and the second player uses O. The players take turns to mark an empty square with their symbol, trying to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three symbols. The player who does so first wins the game. If all squares are filled and no one wins, the game is a draw.

You can choose to play against two levels of computer. In Level 1 the computer uses a predetermined set of rules. In Level 2, the computer uses a minimax algorithm to find the best move.

To make a move, simply press the square you want to play on. The game will check if the move is valid and update the board accordingly.
